# 🐍 LearnPython

This repository contains Python scripts from my first steps in learning the language, exploring fundamental programming concepts through simple exercises.


---

## Overview

The exercises cover a variety of essential topics such as :

- Control flow (loops and conditions)  
- Data structures (lists, tuples, dictionaries)  
- Functions and basic modularity  
- String manipulation and slicing  
- Algorithmic thinking (Fibonacci, palindromes, FizzBuzz)  
- Simple command-line interactions (contact manager)

## Covered Topics

### Iteration and Control Flow
- `for` loops  
- Conditional logic (`if / elif / else`)  
- Basic input validation  

### String and Text Processing
- Reversing text  
- Cleaning and normalizing input  
- Palindrome verification  

### Working with Data Structures
- List operations and accumulation  
- Building dictionaries for word frequencies  
- Sorting tuples with custom keys  

### Introductory Algorithms
- Fibonacci sequence generation  
- Even/odd number classification  
- FizzBuzz logic  

### Simple CLI Program
- Adding, searching, listing, and deleting contacts  
- Basic user-driven menu system 

## Additional Exercises

### Anagram Grouping
- Groups words that are anagrams by sorting letters.  
- Uses modular functions and dictionaries.

### Email Validation
- Checks for a single `@` and a valid domain.  
- Demonstrates string methods and function composition.

### Run-Length Encoding (RLE)
- Compresses strings by counting consecutive letters (e.g., `"aaabbcccc"` → `"a3b2c4"`).  

### Advanced Calculator
- Evaluates expressions with correct operator precedence, including parentheses.  
- Handles tokenization and step-by-step evaluation using a class.
