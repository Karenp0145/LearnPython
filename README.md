# 🐍 LearnPython

This repository contains a collection of Python scripts created during my first steps in learning Python.  
The goal is to explore fundamental programming concepts through simple and progressively more complex exercises.

---

## Overview

The exercises cover a variety of essential topics such as :

- Control flow (loops and conditions)  
- Data structures (lists, tuples, dictionaries)  
- Functions and basic modularity  
- String manipulation and slicing  
- Algorithmic thinking (Fibonacci, palindromes, FizzBuzz)  
- Simple command-line interactions (contact manager)

### Iteration and Control Flow
- `for` loops  
- Conditional logic (`if / elif / else`)  
- Basic input validation  

### String and Text Processing
- Reversing text  
- Cleaning and normalizing input  
- Palindrome verification  

### Working with Data Structures
- List operations and accumulation  
- Building dictionaries for word frequencies  
- Sorting tuples with custom keys  

### Introductory Algorithms
- Fibonacci sequence generation  
- Even/odd number classification  
- FizzBuzz logic  

### Simple CLI Program
- Adding, searching, listing, and deleting contacts  
- Basic user-driven menu system 

### Anagram Grouping
- Sorts words by their letters and groups anagrams 
- Using a clean, modular structure.

### Email Validation
- Checks that an email has one @ and a valid domain 
- Using a simple, organized function setup.
